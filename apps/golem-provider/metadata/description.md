# Self-hosted autonomous passive income from idle hardware resources

The Golem Network is a decentralized network and marketplace where providers can rent out their hardware to requestors, which then pays the providers in GLM tokens for the work they've computed on the provider. It's fully autonomous and it requires no user input at all.

Pricing can be a bit tricky for newcomers, so it's highly recommended to set the CPU/h pricing accordingly to the [median pricing](https://stats.golem.network/network/provider/pricing) on the stats page (CPU per hour) or even less to increase the chance of your node receiving work.

Most payments happen on the Polygon Network, so be sure that the wallet you've got your Ethereum Address from can be used to view/send funds on the polygon Network. If you're using your MetaMask wallet, then you can use it on the official polygon wallet here https://wallet.polygon.technology/

For more information and questions I heavily recommend the official [Golem Discord](https://chat.golem.network). Help is around the corner 24/7 and feel free to direct questions to me. You can find me as the admin named Phillip#9780
